# PROJECT OVERVIEW

Welcome to the culmination of my efforts during the Website Development Course at SAIT. This project represents 
a dynamic web application designed to facilitate appointment scheduling and calculate the associated costs.

## KEY FEATURES
- **Appointment Booking:** Users can seamlessly schedule appointments through the active webpage, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
  
- **Cost Calculation:** The application includes functionality to automatically compute the final cost associated with each appointment,
  streamlining the process for both users and administrators.

**TECHNOLOGIES SHOWCASE:**
